# jami-commander

Jami (https://jami.net) is a privacy-preserving peer-to-peer communication application available on many platforms. `Jami` is in concept similar to `Keet` (https://keet.io), both are peer-to-peer and use servers as little as possible. As a chat app it is similar to `Matrix` (https://http://matrix.org) as both can be self-hosted.

`jami-commander` (`jc` for short) is a simple but convenient CLI-based Jami client app for setting up accounts and swarms as well as sending.

`jami-commander` helps to set up a Jami account, configure the account and send messages and files to Jami peers. It provides the minimal set of commands to use `Jami` from the CLI.

The objective of `jami-commander` is to:

+ be able to use `Jami` from the terminal, the CLI, via SSH, and on head-less servers without monitor.
+ to use minimal resources. No Jami front-end (GUI) needs to be installed.
+ to be able to perform minimal operations to run a bot, e.g. to publish daily weather information
+ be simple. It is written in Python.

Functionality is minimal. You are invited to help to improve `jami-commander`. Pull requests are welcome.

# Installation and Prerequisites

+ `jami-commander` is only a client. It requires the Jami `jamid` daemon to run to performs the work.
+ first install Jami daemon `jamid` as follows:
  + e.g. on Fedora 40 (see https://jami.net/download-jami-linux/ for details)
  + `sudo dnf-3 config-manager --add-repo https://dl.jami.net/stable/fedora_40/jami-stable.repo # add the Jami repo`
  + `sudo dnf install jami-daemon # install only the jamid daemon`
  + e.g. on Ubuntu 24.04 (see https://jami.net/download-jami-linux/ for details)
  + `sudo apt install gnupg dirmngr ca-certificates curl --no-install-recommends`
  + `curl -s https://dl.jami.net/public-key.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jami-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null`
  + `sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jami-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.jami.net/stable/ubuntu_24.04/ jami main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jami.list"`
  + `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install jami-daemon # install only the jamid daemon`
  + This installs around 204MB on Ubuntu
+ second install dependencies
  + e.g. Ubuntu 24.04
  + `sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev`
+ third install `jami-commander`
  + `pip install jami-commander`
  + see also https://pypi.org/pypi/jami-commander
+ run the `jamid` daemon:
  + e.g. on Fedora 40, similar on Ubuntu 24.04, etc.
  + `/usr/libexec/jamid -p & # start the jamid daemon`
+ now you can start and run the `jami-commander`
  + try `jami-commander -h` first to see what is available
